## Project: "Healthy Pikachu"

### Conceptual Description

/// Replace with a description of the ***critical / conceptual dimensions of your project***, with specific reference to the key issues it engages.  These should intersect with the issues that have been explored in the readings and discussions during the first half of class:  eWaste, data security/ownership in relation to corporate cloud infrastructures; critical making; surveillance and privacy, etc. ** *How does your project engage with these issues beyond mere instrumentality?* ** ///

Children are not easily motivated into learning new concepts. Therefore, scholars and companies strive to solve this problem by introducing new products or ideas. As Natalie Jeremijenko states in her interview with Garnet Hertz, she thinks that making stuff is the fundamental of intellectual activity. Children can engage in this intellectual activity when they are making something. Jeremijenko clearly argues that simply assembling Lego for robotics without the knowledge of the right material and function is useless. It is vital for people to understnd the fundamentals in these activities. Therefore, I 

In the early 2000s, children would play with their tamagotchi which was a small digital pet. The pet would eat, sleep, and feel emotions. If it did not get feed properly, the emotion of the pet would change to an upsetting mode. Some children played with the tamagotchi instead of real pets. Although the digital pet was not "real," children would learn responsibilities for taking care of other living things. Recently, Pokemon Go, location-based augmented reality game, was popular and it motivated many people to chase after pokemons. People were traveling to other cities to catch the unique pokemons that did not exist in their city. Many people walked around due to the game. There were many advantages of the introduction of the Pokemon Go to the society.

### Form

/// Your project should be embodied in a ***physical form*** that reflects, embodies, and/or amplifies those your project's main concepts and ideas.///
As I stated in the previous section about tamagotchi and Pokemon Go, I wanted to use a physical form that was appealing to children.
