## Project: "Healthy Pikachu"

### Conceptual Description

/// Replace with a description of the ***critical / conceptual dimensions of your project***, with specific reference to the key issues it engages.  These should intersect with the issues that have been explored in the readings and discussions during the first half of class:  eWaste, data security/ownership in relation to corporate cloud infrastructures; critical making; surveillance and privacy, etc. ** *How does your project engage with these issues beyond mere instrumentality?* ** ///

Children are not easily motivated into learning new concepts. Therefore, scholars and companies strive to solve this problem by introducing new products or ideas. As Natalie Jeremijenko states in her interview with Garnet Hertz, she thinks that making stuff is the fundamental of intellectual activity. Children can engage in this intellectual activity when they are making something. Jeremijenko clearly argues that simply assembling Lego for robotics without the knowledge of the right material and function is useless. It is vital for people to understnd the fundamentals in these activities. In order for people to know the fundamentals, open source is also necessary. Therefore, allowing people, especially children, to engage in the making process with instructions of the whole process of the "Healthy Pikachu" will enable children to learn. The children will not be able to code and only engage in assembling but each step will have explanations for fundamentals to be overviewed. "Healthy Pikachu" allows children to engage in critical making. 

In the early 2000s, children would play with their tamagotchi which was a small digital pet. The pet would eat, sleep, and feel emotions. If it did not get feed properly, the emotion of the pet would change to an upsetting mode. Some children played with the tamagotchi instead of real pets. Although the digital pet was not "real," children would learn responsibilities for taking care of other living things. Recently, Pokemon Go, location-based augmented reality game, was popular and it motivated many people to chase after pokemons. People were traveling to other cities to catch the unique pokemons that did not exist in their city. Many people walked around due to the game. There were many advantages of the introduction of the Pokemon Go to the society. "Healthy Pikachu" will enable children to eat more healthier with the motivation of making Pikachu in a happy state.

### Form

As I stated in the previous section about tamagotchi and Pokemon Go, I wanted to use a physical form that was appealing to children. Pikachu is a fictional character but many people adore it in various forms including stuffed animals, games, and cartoons. Pikachu in a 3D is more real than in a 2D form. When buttons are pushed, there are different reactions from the Pikachu. The first case: green button is pressed and Pikachu is "happy" and the second case: red button is pressed and Pikachu is "sad." People who trigger the buttons reward themself if they ate healthy and punish themselves if they ate unhealthy. This process is motivational to people to have better choices in their eating habits. "Healthy Pikachu" is promoting healthy habits for people. I am planning to add more buttons for other healthy choices such as sleep or exercise. In addition, more information about healthy choices will be sent through email to people who press the button.
